    <p>You are invited to participate in this brief encounter with a beautiful text in a friendly atmosphere. Here our aim will be to saturate ourselves with openness and overcome fear of what is most mysterious.</p>

    <p>In this class we will explore the acts of reading, writing and looking at the sky. We will collectively and individually recite and think from a set of chosen texts, write together and alone, share what weâ€™ve written, read aloud and practice pausing. Through our visual and visceral engagement, we will unearth our wonder, compose a tone, learn to slow and soften our relationships to speech and space. Through this more relaxed relating, what might seem commonplace can be mysterious; what appears immediate might be limitless.</p>

    <p>This class enrolls up to 21 students and will include 3 sessions. New classes will start every two months. </p>

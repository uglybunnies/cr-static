        <h2>Music Chamber</h2>
        <p class="subtitle">Becoming Free Like the Wind</p>
        <JournalButton {...jourButtonPos} /><br>

        <p>The goal of this chamber is to share songs that uplift the spirit and stir up joy in our hearts. So please let loose, sing along, and allow the music to move you! You can share your videos below.</p>
        <p>As long as there has been air to breathe, there has been music dancing on the breeze. The deep and incessant rumbling of drums has ushered armies into battle. The distant sounding of a bell has told time for those who care to count its chimes. A motherâ€™s lilting voice has sung a weary infant back to sleep.</p>

        <p>Even the animal kingdom has contributed to this vast realm of music. The forests would be astonishingly quiet if no songbirds sang. Whales, the largest mammals on the planet, are known for their beautiful vocalisations, though they are rarely heard by human ears.</p>

        <p>Some psychologists believe that before the development of language, music was being made by the emerging pockets of humanity. Whatever the case, the histories of music and language are deeply intertwined. Yet where language so often fails to convey a particular feeling, a rich musical experience can bring one to tears without any words whatsoever. Music elevates the spirit and expresses emotion in its purest form.</p>

            When I sing, <br>
            trouble can sit<br>
            right on my shoulder<br>
            and I don't even notice
